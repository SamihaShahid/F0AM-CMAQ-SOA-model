# F0AM-CMAQ-SOA-model

This repository contains the thermodynamic equillibrium SOA model written in MATLAB so that it can run with F0AM (Framework for 0-D Atmospheric Model). The thermodynamic equilibrium equation is solved numerically using the bisection method. The volatility basis set parameters (saturation concentration (C*), mass yield co-efficient (), enthalpy of SOA precursors) were obtained from CMAQ SOA module AERO7.
